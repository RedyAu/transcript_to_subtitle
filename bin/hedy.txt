Welcome, everybody!
My name is Csaba Kollár and I work at
the Donát Bánki Faculty of Safety
and Mechanical Engineering
at Óbuda University.
I lead the artificial intelligence workshop.
In the next 10-15 minutes,
I will tell you about how
artificial intelligence was developed,
what its history is,
and what led to the fact that
it has now appeared in all areas of life
and is demanding more and more space for itself.
If we turn back the wheel of time,
we see that all engineering developments
also formulated the goal of making the machine
more comfortable, safer,
better, and healthier.
Artificial intelligence is no exception.
When I was a child,
approx. 40 years ago,
I remember the task that
the kindergarten teacher asked us
to draw a vision of what will happen
around the year 2000.
Almost without exception,
all my kindergarten classmates, myself included,
drew a vision of the future where
we could see spaceships and robots,
and we thought that in the 2000s
we would already be flying spaceships 
and that robots would be 
part of our daily lives.
Well, here we are in 2022,
and I came to this recording 
by public transport today,
and I don't think there is 
anyone among us who has ever 
flown in a spaceship.
We also see robots appearing in our lives,
but the era has not yet arrived 
when every family has 
a physical robot to help them in their work.
If we look at cybernetics,
which was the age before artificial intelligence,
we could see ideas from the 1950s,
when developments were more conscious
of how to make the world better 
in a way that would greatly influence our future.
Cybernetics laid the foundations,
but they were still basically theoretical 
since the technological environment 
that would have made it possible to test 
so many models in practice was not available.
And then we arrive in time to July 2018,
when the ethical guidelines 
related to artificial intelligence 
were formulated by the European Commission,
which basically outlines 
a future image created with 
humane artificial intelligence 
as a guideline for us.
But in order not to run so far ahead in time,
I would also like to talk about 
what are the 3-4 building blocks 
of artificial intelligence,
which made possible 
the practical implementation 
- of cybernetics theory.
First, the data.
We know that we had a lot of data 
available before,
but with the spread of 
different sensor techniques and databases,
we have even more data available.
This amount of data means 
that their storage has already been solved,
but they only become a source of 
valuable information 
if we can process them in some way.
Here we have arrived 
at the second building block 
of artificial intelligence,
computational capacity.
With the increase 
in computing capacity in computers,
we have reached a time when we can process 
much more data in a much shorter time.
Our data processing could become 
much more efficient and effective.
It is useless to have data and computing capacity 
if there is no suitable software background.
This can also be called algorithms.
As the data expanded and 
the computing capacity increased along with it,
we are able to run the algorithms 
in real or near real-time,
which are now able to solve 
more and more complex problems 
or at least offer solution alternatives.
And in addition to the three building blocks,
I also talk about a fourth one,
which is synergy.
This means that different techniques 
and technologies are increasingly 
developing and connecting.
And if these technologies are 
as seamless as possible,
we can see how we can 
effectively focus on and solve 
a more complex and complicated problem.

We are often asked when we can
talk about autonomy in the case of machines,
computers, and artificial intelligence.
In connection with autonomy,
I most often mention the Sheridan scale,
which is a 10-point scale,
the very first point of which 
is that the machine does not provide any help,
the person does everything.
And when we get to point 10,
when you say that 
the machine makes its own decisions,
it works automatically and ignores the human.
Between the 10 steps,
we can observe the development 
of the machine's autonomy.
Well, many people express concerns 
about artificial intelligence,
then they mention that the fact that the machine 
decides everything by itself 
gives it such a level of autonomy 
that it does not need a human.
When some formulate 
a dystopian vision of the future,
they draw attention to the fact that 
we cannot allow artificial intelligence 
to reach such a level.

Well, I think that artificial intelligence 
has already reached this level in some areas.
Moreover, when it comes to 
self-driving cars 
or the management of smart cities,
we cannot ignore the possibility that 
humans cannot process 
a lot of information in a short time,
so we rely on artificial intelligence 
to process them.
Even in decision-making time,
human intelligence can be much longer 
than the machine's reaction time,
which means that we are not able 
to react so quickly to external circumstances.

So, if artificial intelligence 
is developed in the right way 
and with ethical principles,
we can reach the previously mentioned level 10,
which means that artificial intelligence 
makes decisions independently, ignores humans,
but can only make decisions 
that help the accessibility 
of the previously mentioned comfortable,
safe and happier life to people.
When we talk about artificial intelligence,
we often talk about how it appears and in what form.
The first suggestion is usually about 
whether artificial intelligence has 
some form of practical appearance.
It has no physical body; 
it is somewhere in the cloud 
and it communicates with us through 
sensors and actuators.
If we look at artificial intelligence 
embodied or installed in a machine,
quite a few examples could be listed.
The first is smart devices worn on the body.
For example, a smartwatch, and smart shoes.
Next are smart devices 
that can be worn in the body,
such as implants and various smart devices 
that monitor our health.
The next step is portable devices,
then humanoid android robots,
intelligent self-driving vehicles,
intelligent buildings, domotics systems,
and intelligent companies.
Here I would highlight the possibilities 
of Industry 4.0 and Logistics 4.0 systems,
the possibilities of intelligent settlements,
the intelligent country,
and finally the intelligent earth.
Now I would like to talk a little more 
about the possibilities of 
Industry 4.0 and Logistics 4.0.
Basically, they want to emphasize 
that production is optimized.

In practice, this means that 
the production process should be 
as fast as possible using as little energy as possible,
minimize production costs and waste,
create a safe working environment and based on this,
realize as much profit as possible.

This is supported by Logistics 4.0,
which provides inputs at the right time 
and in the right place, i.e.
the delivery of raw or various 
semi-finished products to the plant,
the storage of finished products,
or their delivery to customers.

In connection with Industry 4.0,
some people are already talking about Industry 5.0.
This is interesting because Industry 4.0 
is criticized for not being 
human-centered enough and too technocratic.
Industry 5.0 will be 
a more human-centered stage of development.
If it is already more humane,
artificial intelligence will 
appear just as in Industry 4.0.

The previously mentioned 
2018 European Union recommendation 
on ethical artificial intelligence is also 
in the field of production and logistics,
which means that instead of the current,
somewhat technocratic approach,
we can find more humane solutions.
What does this mean for us?
The fact that man and machine 
can work together also means that the machine 
can serve man in such a way 
that we can work in a safer 
and more comfortable working environment.
It also means that people do not disappear 
from the factories but are given new tasks 
that help them operate faster and more efficiently.
If we wanted to summarize 
ethical artificial intelligence in one sentence,
and with this, I would like to close 
my short presentation today,
we could say that we expect the same 
from artificial intelligence 
as we did from machines before.
Make our lives more beautiful, happier,
more comfortable, safer, and healthier.
What else do we expect from artificial intelligence?
To make it work so that people are at the center.
And this can be achieved by colleagues 
developing artificial intelligence keeping 
humane thinking and human-scale planning in mind 
so that we can actually create a better,
more comfortable world.
Thank you for your kind attention.
